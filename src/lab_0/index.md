<h4>Training Notes</h4>

* Took 10 days off in September to let niggles simmer down
* Ran races in May, August and September: 5K, 5K, [1 mile](https://results.nyrr.org/event/25FAM/finishers#search=Jennie%2520Coughlin&page=1)
* Cut 4 minutes off my 5K time from May to August


<H4>How Many Miles Will I Run in October?</h4>
<ul>
      <li>Two races in October, a 5K and 10K.</li>
      <li>On race day, I run about 1.5 miles for a warm up and about 1 mile for a cool-down.</li>
      <li>Goal is 4-5 mils, 4-5 days a week.</li>
      <li>5K is 3.1 miles.</li>
      <li>I ran 10.2 miles in the first couple of days of the month. Four full weeks remain after that.</li>
      <li>But I also had to take four days off at the start of the month because of a nasty cold.</li> 
    </ul>
